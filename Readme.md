The Mailer Suite
=============
By Tom Harvey - [@tombuildsstuff](http://twitter.com/tombuildsstuff) - [ibuildstuff.co.uk](http://ibuildstuff.co.uk)

The Mailer Suite is a set of applications used to send personalised messages to your contacts.

Connecting into your Google Contacts account, it's possible to send a personalised birthday/happy new years message to your contacts.

Texts are currently sent using Clickatell ([pricing available here](http://www.clickatell.com/pricing/message_cost.php)) - but this can easily be swapped out to use other providers.
